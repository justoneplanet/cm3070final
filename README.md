# Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a public dataset

## What problem is this project solving?

Choosing, based on a quantitative evaluation, a well performing machine learning model for used with a publicly available dataset.

## What is the background and context to the question above in 150 words or less?

Pick a dataset from Kaggle.com – choose one that interests you or you think is important – for example: tweets, faces, lung scans, skin diseases, student grades…

Develop a deep learning classificatation/regression model for your chosen dataset by following the methodology of Deep Learning with Python. Aim to find the best model – work from simple to deep and employ the advanced techniques of Chapter 7.

## List some recommended sources for students to begin their research

- F.Chollet, Deep Learning with Python, 1st ed.
- Kaggle.com

## What would the final product look like?

(e.g. presentation, usability, functionality, results)?
A research project – the final product is a report

## What would a prototype look like?

- What would it show?
- What does it need to prove?
- What IS important to make clear?
- What is NOT important at this stage?

**The prototype is a baseline model that achieves a common sense prediction.**

It is not important to achieve the accuracy of any puplished paper on this dataset (or any of the Kaggle public notebooks)

## What kinds of techniques/processes are relevant to this project?

Jupyter notebooks

Tensorflow, matplotlib and associated Python libraries

## What would the output of these techniques/processes look like?

- Model code
- Validation plots
- Prediction on test set

## How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of the project)? What criteria are important?

- Does the model significantly improve on a commonsense baseline
- Have I investigated all the alternatives

### For this brief, what would a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?

- Any original model that runs and produces a prediction
- A basic evaluation of the model on the public dataset
- Report is well-strutured

### For this brief, what would a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?

In addition to minimum pass criteria:

- A sequence of orginal models of increasing depth and sophistication
- An evaluation of the different models using the public dataset, which makes it possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of different models and choose a preferred model
- Report: Correct application of the DL methodology; good standard of written, technical English

### For this brief, what would an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?

In addition to the good criteria:

- Replication of a hight quality published model(s) on the chosen dataset
- An evaluation of the models to the standard of academic research
- The report is a **self-contained explanation** and account of theory and experiment. There is a literature review and the work is contextualised. Critical comparison of best model and re-implemented model(s) and results in the literature.
