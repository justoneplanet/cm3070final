    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use public datasets, such as SAMSum and CNN daily mail datasets, to build a text summarization model. Text summarization task means generating a short organized summary from a long article, such as news, through extracting and abstracting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a research project in which I investigate recent trends and deepen my knowledge of Deep Learning, which goes beyond the contents of CM3015, and a text summarization model is eventually built.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this project supposes an organization or a group is the user, such as a (web) system development company with little machine-learning knowledge. Therefore, the deliverable report must be scientific and convincing to explain why each parameter is adopted and be knowledgeable for its developers. The deliverable code and model must run easily on common devices, such as a web server. Mobile devices, on the other hand, might not be able to run the large model because they have a smaller amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is interesting and motivative (Rapid Evolution) \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, various types of text representations and neural network models have been developed, especially since the Transformer model was invented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the One-hot-encoding introduced in CM3015, I am going to use other techniques, such as word2vec and GloVe, that can appropriately handle the meanings of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network is a vector transformation. It is worth investigating how well each representation of embedding layers can capture the characteristics of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer is one of the most common and game-changing models for sequential data, such as text. In addition, it is also used in text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM), and so on. There are a lot of derived models based on the Transformer architecture, such as BERT, which outperforms others in natural language processing. [10] Whereas another model based on the Transformer, named Vision Transformer, has been used for image recognition tasks to overcome CNN's weaknesses recently. [9] Moreover, there is a more efficient model based on the Transformer model, which is called the Retentive Network. Because all these architectures are based on the Transformer model, deepening its knowledge leads to the understanding of whole machine learning. Additionally, even in the future, a number of new architectures based on the Transformer models will be released.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is interesting and motivative (from the aspect of efficiency and ecology)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the performances of various models is one of the exciting and essential points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced models do not always achieve the best performance. For example, when the Recurrent Neural Network model, which is one of the advanced models, is used for a text classification task, even though it does not always work better than a dense model, it mostly consumes greater computing resources. [11] That is, it completely wastes resources. I am going to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model in terms of practical uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As recent investigations indicate, building LLM models indirectly emits a significant amount of CO2. That is, the investigation of efficiency that leads to the ecology is socially meaningful, even in the environmental aspect. However, since there are not enough computing resources to build an LLM model, this project does not target building an LLM itself."

    "The architecture of the Transformer, which consists of both encoders and decoders, is introduced with a simple figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper indicates the algorithms and architecture of the Transformer with formulas, comparing the former architectures, such as the recurrent neural network model and the gate recurrent unit model. How to reduce the amount of calculation for longer input sequences, which is one of the defects, is also introduced kindly. However, because of the nature of the paper, the concrete implementation is not shown on it. Instead, it provides a link to a GitHub repository, \"tensor2tensor,\" [2] where some implementations with Python code are introduced. However, since the repository has not been updated by the owner, it is pretty uncertain whether they can run on the current Python environment or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because the Transformer was initially developed for the machine translation task, various tasks except translation are not mentioned in this paper, written in 2017. Thereby, the effectiveness of the Transformer is not investigated for a wide range of NLP tasks here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning, hyperparameter tunings are obviously required to investigate effectiveness. The section \"6.2 Model Variations\" describes the parameters such as the number of heads, the parameters of the optimizer, and so on that exist in the Transformer model, and the same indicators will be used to compare the performance in this project.

    "The performance comparison between the RetNet and the Transformer has been executed for large language models and represents the improvement. They are executed and compared for large language models and that difference might not be remarkable on smaller models such as text summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The section \"3 Experiments\" mentions the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Perplexity decreases along with scaling up the model size. We empirically observe that RetNet tends to outperform Transformer when the model size is larger than 2B. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model size is larger than 2.7B, with more than 2.7 billion parameters, the advantages of the RetNet model might finally be detected.\n",

    "The section \"3.3 Training Cost\" shows the specific environment where the evaluation of this paper was executed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We evaluate the results with eight Nvidia A100-80GB GPUs, because FlashAttention is highly optimized for A100. Tensor parallelism is enabled for 6.7B and 13B models. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a text summarization model in this project is mainly executed on the local macOS machine, which has an M2 CPU, which has a significantly different architecture from Nvidia GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Moreover, without relying on specific kernels, it is easy to train RetNet on other platforms efficiently. For example, we train the RetNet models on an AMD MI200 cluster with decent throughput. It is notable that RetNet has the potential to further reduce cost via advanced implementation, such as kernel fusion. [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the above quote mentioned the performance on the other device, the environment is highly parallelized, and it is uncertain if this project can derive beneficial knowledge through experimental comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this does not matter directly to this project, as the sections \"2.3 Overall Architecture of Retention Networks\" and \"3.4 Inference Cost\" mention, the inference cost of the RetNet model is remarkably $O(1)$. [3] In the case where the quick response for longer sequences/tokens is required, the RetNet model can be one of the realistic choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Text Summarization: A Critical Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Wojciech et al. (2019) introduced and evaluated the current shortcomings of text summarization.[4] The methodology of the evaluation should be notable in this paper. The previously introduced 2 papers are not for text summarization tasks, and the BLEU metric is used, which is for the evaluation of translation task performance. This is not for summarization tasks. Though loss values probably evaluate the performances, they cannot clearly consider sentences' structures for evaluations. Therefore, following this paper, the ROUGE metric is used in this project. Fortunately, KerasNLP has the following 2 metrics as standard.\n",
    "\n",

    "- [ROUGE-L](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/metrics/rouge_l/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the ROUGE-N metric uses n-gram to refer to the overlap, and the ROUGE-L metric uses the longest common subsequence that can detect the sentence level structure. [8]\n",

    "Though the following does not matter directly, some shortcomings of the current summarization model are introduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though a summarization task depends on the reader's expectations and prior knowledge, the current models are not provided as additional information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chin-Yew Lin suggested the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) to measure the quality of a summary text. [36] Tough, human judgments were traditionally used for the evaluation of the text summarization quality, it was time-consuming and costly even for simple manual evaluation, and it is impossible to be frequently executed. ROUGE is one of the methods, which correlates to human judgments, to programmatically measure the quality of summarized text. The quation is introduced as follows;\n",

    "Bogdan Gliwa et al. introduced the SAMSum Corpus, which is an abstractive dialogue summaries. [37] The paper shows that dedicated models and non-standard evaluations are required for an abstractive dialogue summarization.\n",

    "In this paper, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) model, where a pre-trained model and a scratch model are combined, is compared with other typical models for text summarization tasks, and it is concluded that the BERT model outperformed others. However, it seems slightly unclear whether the pre-trained model actually works better because there is not a comparison of the same architecture model between pre-trained and scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the section \"Introduction\" mentions, the BERT model, one of the Transformer models, has affected word and sentence representation. Thus, this model may become a research target in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When fine-tuning for a specific task, unlike ELMo whose parameters are usually fixed, parameters in BERT are jointly fine-tuned with additional task- specific parameters. [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, as the above is written, since the pretrained BERT model goes through the fine-tuning phase, it might take longer time for training than fixed parameters' models such as word2vec and GloVe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table of the section \"3.3 Abstractive Summarization\" holds the various types of datasets.\n",
    "Though this might not matter to the paper, apart from CNN DailyMail, NYT, and XSum are used as the datasets. In this project, the CNN dailymail will be utilized as a dataset. However, they are kept as sub plans, preparing for unexpected situations.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the superiority and effectiveness of the Transformer and its self-attention have been shown, compared with the other architectures such as the recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network. Whereas performances, tunings, other NLP tasks, and architectures, which determine if encode or/and decode is used, have not been shown. And that is what I aim to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have slightly changed my mind while reading papers. Specifically, instead of regarding the RetNet model as the main topic, hyperparameter tunings of the Transformer model are going to be mainly researched. The RetNet model will be researched optionally. The reason is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RetNet paper shows that it is effective only for large language models.\n",
    "- The experiments on the ResNet paper were executed on the highly parallelized environment, which is different from the local machine that is used in this project.\n",
    "- The training to build a text summarization model takes a considerable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, because a beneficial report may not be provided if most resources are invested in experiments with little chance of seeing differences, I am going to make the experiment about the RetNet model optional. Instead, clearly beneficial hyperparameter tunings are executed in the first half to ensure users' benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the comparison between the pre-trained models and non-pre-trained models will also be one of the interesting topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it might be very difficult to self-build a text summarization model and mark a better score of ROUGE metrics on the current local machine because the models of Google and Facebook are trained with a number of layers and parameters using high computational GPUs. However, it might be possible to build a smaller model that is beneficial for a specific environment. Since KerasNLP provides an easy way to use Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer (BART), the performance might be able to get close to the Google or Facebook results if it is used. [33]"

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen the template \"Deep Learning on a public dataset\" of CM3015 \"Machine Learning and Neural Networks\". In this project, I build a text summarization model with public datasets, such as the SAMSum corpus and the Cable News Network(CNN) dailymail datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other templates of other courses, the deliverables are the machine learning model and its documents, and this project does not have user interfaces for end users. However, I assume to deliver the machine learning model to an organization that has a plan where the text summarization model is integrated into a system, which has actual end users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the aspect of a research project where I investigate recent trends and deepen my knowledge of Deep Learning that was not sufficiently covered in the CM3015 course. Day by day and month by month, the field and market of deep learning technology for natural language processing is rapidly growing. The deliverable document is going to be beneficial for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain and Users\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned above, unlike other project templates, the project template on CM3015 does not have a specific user. However, since it is difficult to determine what is beneficial and how beneficial a feature is without specific users, I assume that users are developers outside the organization who want to install a machine learning feature and model into a currently running system. Specifically, that is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not familiar with deep learning but with server-side applications of Python, and they want to adopt a text summarization feature into a current running system. My job is solving the problem and providing text summarization models and their knowledgeable and beneficial documents to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justify features based on domain and users\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, end users do not mind if a model is highly advanced or not. Instead, they mind the time and performance of response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the Transformer model used?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, text summarization models are built. That is, the neural network learns sequences as the input to output another sequences as the output. The Transformer model is superior to the Dense model to process sequences data. That is the reason why the Transformer model is used for the text summarization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On text classification tasks, well-tuned dense layer models overcome advanced models, such as a Transformer model, an Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) model and so on, under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, text generation tasks, such as text summarization, could not achieve satisfactory outcomes for a long time. Encoder-decoder models, text embeddings, and Transformer, which can handle sequences well have made them possible. That is why the Transformer model is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is hyperparameter tuning necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of hypterparameters in a neural network model, and there does not exist a formula that can derive optimized their values. They depend on each dataset and architecture. The best parameter set must be found with hyperparameter tunings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to testing advanced models, the hyperparameter tunings should be executed sufficiently. Even if an advanced model such as RetNet outperforms a traditional model, it is impossible to compare the advanced model and the traditional model fairly without hyperparameter tunings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairly comparisons derive better models that are beneficial for users. That is the reason why hypter parameter tunings are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the RetNet model reseached optionally?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, the other cutting-edge models, such as the RetNet model, are examined. Generally, end users do not mind if a model is highly advanced model or not. Instead, they mind the time and performance of response. Whereas, it might be able to efficiently use resources, and that might lead to the reduction of the cost for users. This is one of the reason why the research of the RetNet model is made optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which dataset is mainly used?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reseach, the following datasets are compared to choose one of them to build a model. These datasets have been mainly from the Tensorflow datasets catalog since this project adopted Tensorflow.

    "\n",
    "I introduce libraries and technologies here. To be correct and objective, I explain them in my own words as little as possible, citing public documents, and websites. Instead, I explain how each technology and library is used in my own words for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a machine learning library, which is mainly used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An end-to-end open source machine learning platform for everyone. Discover TensorFlow's flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources. [12]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the TensorFlow library is used not only for building text summarization models but also for most other tasks from the beginning to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an OSS neural network library. It depends on the library version, it can switch Tensorflow to other machine learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. Keras also gives the highest priority to crafting great documentation and developer guides. [14]\n",
    "\n",
    "This library is used throughout the whole project to manipulate the TensorFlow library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KerasNLP\n",
    "\n",
    "> KerasNLP is a natural language processing library that works natively with TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch. Built on Keras 3, these models, layers, metrics, and tokenizers can be trained and serialized in any framework and re-used in another without costly migrations. [16]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the Transformer model, which consists of the Transformer encoder layer and the Transformer decoder layer, is used to build text summarization models. It is possible to self-implement them by following the paper and books. However, it might unintentionally include bugs. Then, the model and its documents lose the reliability for readers. Therefore, the KerasNLP, which is a part of the widely known library \"Keras\" and contains the Transformer layer classes, is utilized here to secure the reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a lot of hyperparameter tunings are executed in this project. Their classes in KerasNLP is well-architected so that hyperparameters are easily injected to each layer. This is another reason why the KerasNLP is used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another OSS machine learning library. PyTorch is featured with the following characteristics according to the official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Production Ready**\\\n",
    "> Transition seamlessly between eager and graph modes with TorchScript, and accelerate the path to production with TorchServe.\\\n",
    "> **Distributed Training**\\\n",
    "> Scalable distributed training and performance optimization in research and production is enabled by the torch.distributed backend.\\\n",
    "> **Robust Ecosystem**\\\n",
    "> A rich ecosystem of tools and libraries extends PyTorch and supports development in computer vision, NLP and more.\\\n",
    "> **Cloud Support**\\\n",
    "> PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling.\\\n",
    "> [17]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not directly used for the project development. However, some text summarization models that I have introduced has been developed with this PyTorch library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a software library of Hugging Face, Inc. The official repository of GitHub introduces as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio. [18]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our model hub. At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments. [18]\n",
    "\n",
    "> Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other. [18]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have investigated the following 2 text summarization models as a part of competitive research.\n",

    "They are distributed through huggingface and the Transformers library is necessary to use these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Plan (Gantt Chart)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 2 to 3 weeks are used to develop the basic Transformer model. Its part of the document is written at the same time. After that, hyperparameter tunings are repeatedly executed with small cycles so that they are efficient. The uncertainty of this phase is the length of training time. The optional implementation for the RetNet model keeps aside the time of 3 weeks. At last, there is a time for the documentation and the buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/gantt_chart.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal testing, which is for machine learning models, and hypothesis verification are executed to evaluate the project. However, the human tester is not used to check performance because it is difficult to organize the tester team for this project free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For the test dataset, the following metrics are used to measure and test model performance. This is executed to numerically prove how better a generated model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- loss\n",
    "- ROUGE-N\n",
    "- ROUGE-L\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verification of hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The following hypotheses are verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tunings are significantly effective even on a Transformer model.\n",
    "- Transformer models can generate text more sophisticatedly than dense layer models.\n",
    "- The encoder-decoder model of the Transformer works better for text summarization tasks than the only-decoder model.\n",
    "- Pre-trained models improve the text summarization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following hypothesis is verified as a result of an optional implementation, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RetNet architecture for a small model does not make a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, it is seemingly difficult to verify the following hypotheses in this project, even though they are interesting topics. The first one is a thought during the prototype implementation. A huge Transformer model is essential to verify the first hypothesis, and it is impossible for the current local environment to run. And no one has solved the second one as far as I have read a number of papers. That is, the task of text summarization is strongly related to human prior knowledge and understanding of the things that are summarized. Thus, I am going to exclude them from the verification of the project temporarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An excessive number of units and layers for the number of dataset entries overfits.\n",
    "- Prior knowledge and bias cannot be solved on the current architecture.\n"

    "First, there are three types of Transformer models: Transformer encoder-only model, Transformer decoder-only model, and Transformer encoder-decoder model. Here are three types of different machine-learning tasks with the Transformer for each type.\n",

    "1. The Transformer encoder-only model for the text classification task\n",

    "Generally, the encoder-decoder model of the Transformer is used for text summarization tasks. However, the decoder-only model might be able to be used. In any case, there is a necessity to verify whether each model and each API of libraries can actually work. This time, the KerasNLP library is used to add the encoder and decoder layers of the Transformer. The reasons why the KerasNLP library is utilized are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stability\n",
    "- Concise of parameter experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The book \"Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition\" [7] introduces the simplified Transformer implementation that works in the local environment. However, it is not certain how widely it is used, and it might not pass any testing. In addition, even though it is good to understand how the Transformer works internally because it is simplified, it is difficult for us to experiment with various parameters."

This time, the encoder and decoder model of the Transformer is adopted. However, this is not a requirement of the text summarization model. The decoder-only model of the Transformer might be able to build the text summarization model and achieve a good performance. This will be an experiment in this report.\n",

Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer).

Even though the encoder sequence length can be shortened to reduce the memory consumption, we must be careful because it loses the features from the dataset text."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I have reseached text summarization tasks experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was easier for the model to overfit to the training dataset. To avoid that, the number of epochs should have been set to the point where the validation loss was minimum and the validation accuracy was maximum. Finally, the loss value was larger and accuracy value was lower, compared to general classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fist basic Transformer model was trained only with the dataset that I have downloaded. Even though the various hyperparameter tunings were executed to the this model, the loss value only got slightly smaller and the accuracy value only got slightly larger. \n",
    "The second BART model, which was pre-trained with corpora, such as BooksCorpus, English Wikipedia, and CommonCrawl, [40] was fine-tuned with the dataset that I have downloaded. This BART model easily overwhelmed the first basic Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That indicates the importance and necessity of the pre-training, which is based on the transfer learning. In other words, the model with the fundamental comprehension for the whole language, English in this case, is effective for the text summarization task. Whereas, the model without the language comprehension overfitted easily because the dataset is everything for the model and the model does not have English knowledge at all. As a result, it was problematic from the aspect of the generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiments of this research, critical problems with the dataset biases did not emerge. However, all datasets contain biases and they might be problematic. For example, the paper \"The Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models: Revealing Demographic Bias through Job Recommendations\" [39] reveals the inequality on Large Language Models (LLM) on job recommendations as follows;\n",
    "\n",
    "> We demonstrate the mere mention of nationality or gender identity can significantly skew results, and developers should be hyper-aware of introducing biases into the system. If demographic attributes are necessary, developers should critically evaluate how to incorporate this information fairly and conduct experiments to understand and address biases.\n",
    "> [39]\n",
    "\n",
    "Just in terms of the controllability of the models, the bare Transformer model holds the advantage over the BART model because the problematic entries can be excluded from the training dataset or be weakened from the perspective of the whole model. Therefore, the best practice might be that the BART model actually runs and the bare Transformer model is prepared as a sub-plan for a problematic situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "It took a lot of time to identify the following problems in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The loss value is higher and the accuracy value is lower than expected.\n",
    "2. The training speed is slower than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitation of a model is know only empirically. That is, when we face a lower performance than we expected, it is quite difficult to logically identify whether the reason is the limitation of the model architecture or unknown bugs cause the lower performance. As a result, there are repeatedly code reviews with the suspicion that there should be bugs causing the low performance. In this time consuming process, some minor bugs were fixed. For example, one of the bugs caused wrong transformations of tensors where the end Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) tags are added incorrectly. However, they were not so impactful to its performance. And the TensorBoard tool was used to visualize the model graph in order to find unknow bugs. Eventually, the limitation of the model architecture was found out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, what speed is usual is also know only empirically. \n",
    "\n",
    "_ | NVIDIA V100 GPU x 1 | Apple Silicon M2 | Intel mac\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "1 step time | 3~10 times faster | - | 10 times slower\n",
    "RAM | 16 GB GPU memory | 32 GB | -\n",
    "tensorflow-text/BART | works well | partially works | -\n",
    "\n",
    "The M2 Mac machine was mainly used as the development machine. Initially, the tensorflow-metal should be used to accelerate it. It makes faster. However, the NVIDIA V100 GPU environment is at least 3 times faster. Especially, when the RAM of the Mac is not enough for calculations, that makes a lot of swaps and at least 3 times slower than usual. The old Intel Mac was 10 times slower than the M2 Mac and useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, when the tensor data overflowed from the NVIDIA V100 16GB GPU memory, the training program was killed the Out Of Memory error (OOM). That is, it must calculate only within 16GB. Due to this restriction, there was the necessity to change the dataset from the CNN dailymail dataset to the SAMSum dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research, the KerasNLP library was used and some classes was dependent the tensorflow-text library. When the research started, the tensorflow-text library was not supported Apple Silicon Mac and the situation did not changed until July 2024. Even though it started supporting, the BART model does not work yet."
