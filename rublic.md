- [x] 0 points No
- [x] 2 points No, but... there are some attempts to justify the concept, but without evidence

### Is the final implemenation of high quality?

- [x] 0 points No, there is no implementation described
- [x] 6 points No, but, there is no working prototype, but there is some attempt at making one
- [x] 12 points Yes, but... there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “acceptable” level of project described in the template
- [x] 15 points Yes, but... there is a prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the “good” or “excellent” level of project described in the template, but it has many bugs and flaws
