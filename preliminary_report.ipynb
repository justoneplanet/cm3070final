    "# Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "I aim to explore the current understanding of machine learning model architectures and their performances, focusing on the key technology \"Transformer\". Moreover, in this project, I investigate the effectiveness of the Transformer and finally build a text summarization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed a new simple architecture, named Transformer, based on attention mechanisms without recurrence and convolutions. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the Transformer, which consists of both encoders and decoders, is introduced with a simple figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper indicates the algorithms and architecture of the Transformer with formulas, comparing the former architectures such as the recurrent neural network model and the gate recurrent unit model. How to reduce the amount of calculation for longer input sequences, which is one of the defects, is also introduced kindly. However, because of the nature of the paper, the concrete implementation is not shown on it. Instead, it provides a link to a GitHub repository, \"tensor2tensor,\" [2] where some implementations with Python code are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though these codes might still be beneficial, They have not been maintained for years. It is pretty uncertain whether it can run on the current Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Transformer was initially developed for the machine translation task, various tasks except translation are not mentioned in this paper written in 2017. Thereby, the effectiveness of the Transformer is not investigated for a wide range of NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning, hyperparameter tunings are obviously required to investigate effectiveness. The section \"6.2 Model Variations\" describes the parameters such as the number of heads, the parameters of the optimizer, and so on that exist in the Transformer model, and the same indicators will be used to compare the performance in this project. And the experiment environment, which the paper disclosed, is useful to the experiments in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have obtained the following beneficial knowledge, even though it is not directly related to my project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of heads is neither too many nor too few\n",
    "- Interpretable models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are not following items that are essential for this project in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sufficient benchmarks for various NLP tasks/applications\n",
    "- Minimum viable and runnable code in the modern environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## RetNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Yutao et al. (2023) proposed the Retentive Network (RetNet), which is a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the drawbacks of the Transformer, which is introduced in this paper, is the slow inference and inefficiency due to multi-head attention.\n",
    "The performance comparison between the RetNet and the Transformer has been executed for large language models and represents the improvement. They are executed and compared for large language models and that difference might not be remarkable on smaller models such as text summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Text Summarization: A Critical Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Wojciech et al. (2019) introduced and evaluated the current shortcomings of text summarization.[4] Specifically, automatically connected datasets contain detrimental noises, the current evaluation protocols are weakly correlated with human judgment, and the models are overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Yang et al. (2019) indicated the effectiveness of the BERT, which is an abbreviation of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, for text summarization, which is one of the NLP tasks. [5]\n",
    "In this paper, the Transformer and its subspicies have advanced various NLP tasks and the effectiveness of pre-trained models has been investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the superiority and effectiveness of the Transformer have been shown, compared with the other architectures such as the recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network. Whereas performances, tunings, other NLP tasks, and architectures, which determine if encode or/and decode is used, have not been shown. And that is what I aim to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been changing my mind while reading papers. Since I can not prepare a large-scale computing environment in this project from the cost aspect, it might be better to investigate encoding and embedding text rather than researching advanced models such as RetNet. Because even if computationally efficient and effective models are researched in this project, there are no appropriate satisfying resources that are computationally costly to verify the effectiveness. So, it is preferable to research text representation for accuracy and performance, which are measurable in the current local environment, rather than applying and measuring computationally efficient models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the comparison between the pre-trained models and non-pre-trained models will also be one of the interesting topics. That will be the motivation to do the same comparison in this project.\n",

    "Here are three types of machine learning tasks of the Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transformer classification task\n",
    "2. Transformer text generation task\n",
    "3. Transformer text summarization task\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first classification task, it is indicated that the Transformer parts in the Keras and KerasNLP library actually work. The second text generation task shows how long a generative task takes time. It is essential to estimate the working time for a lot of experiments that are executed for performance comparisons. The third one is a minimum viable code for the text summarization task."

    "## Transformer classification task\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a Transformer classification model is built so that the local environment determines if it can run or not. This time, the KerasNLP library is used to add the encoder and decoder layers of the Transformer. The reasons why the KerasNLP library is utilized are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stability\n",
    "- Parameters for experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The book \"Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition\" [10] introduces the simplified Transformer implementation that actually works in the local environment. However, it is not certain how widely it is used and it might not pass any testing. In addition, even though it is good for us to understand how the Transformer works internally because it is simplified, it is difficult for us to experiment with various parameters."

In this case, it took over 4 hours. That is one of the reasons why I have changed my plan, where the RetNet model is an optional topic. Even though the Retentive Network model will make the training 8.4 times faster in the aspect of the throughput, which is shown in the paper, the same Transformer model training must be executed for the comparison. The experiments will still take a lot of time, and that is not realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the investigation of the RetNet model is the main topic and consumes most of the time, notable differences may not be derived as a result of fewer training attempts. That devalues this report. Therefore, the RetNet model should be an optional topic to avoid that case, and other comparisons, such as text representations, should be preferred. That must make this report more beneficial.\n"
